# LLM in Containers - Examples and Guides

## Overview
Welcome to the LLM in Containers repository! This project is dedicated to providing comprehensive examples and guidelines for running Large Language Models (LLMs) and related tools in the ecosystem in containers. Our primary focus is on utilizing tools like Docker and Kubernetes to create scalable, reproducible, and easily deployable LLM applications.

## Motivation
The advent of LLMs has revolutionized various sectors from natural language processing to AI-driven content creation. However, deploying these models efficiently and effectively remains a challenge due to their size and complexity. Containerization offers a solution by encapsulating the model, its dependencies, and the runtime environment, ensuring that it runs consistently across different computing environments. This repository aims to lower the barrier to entry for utilizing LLMs in a containerized setup, fostering innovation and experimentation.
